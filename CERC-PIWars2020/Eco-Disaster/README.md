# Eco-Disaster

This challenge requires OpenCV to be installed (if there any big changes between versions, you will have to change your code) The OpenCV version most of us should be using is 4.0 (at least). If you don't have a set of barrels and course, you can unzip the images and use them for testing. The picture with the barrels closest to the camera is img-20.png .
